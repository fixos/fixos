Machine-specific root directory, for now only Renesas SH3 family is really
supported, so don't consider the given directory structure is definitive (in
fact it's more an attempt to have easier ports in the future).

Proposed solution is :
+ arch/                # root directory for all machine-specific low-level stuff
|    + generic/        # headers designed to be included in generic parts
|    |    + something.h
|    |    + other.h
|    + sh/             # directory for SuperH "Architecture Family" (SuperH family)
|    |    + include/   # headers added to system header path for each compiled file
|    |    |    + arch/
|    |    |         + something.h
|    |              + various-defs.h
|    |    + sh3/       # SH3 specific stuff directory
|    |    |     + specific.c
|    |    + sh4/
|    |    |     + specific.c
|    |    + all_superh.c
|    |    + private.h
|    + x86/            # other architecture family....


In the given example, if FiXos is compiled for SuperH, arch-specific includes
will be found in "arch/sh/include/arch/" directory, and can be included in
generic parts of the kernel using :
#include <arch/file.h>

The idea behind arch/generic directory is to provide the "generic machine
interface", the functions used to perform low-level actions that have a meaning
in all supported machines. These functions are designed to be implemented in
machine-specific directories, but there prototypes should be used everywhere,
and a working implementation is expected for the core of the kernel.
As there are often types or macros that are machine-specific, there should
be defined in the corresponding header file in arch/<ARCH_FAMILY>/include/arch/.
If possible, these definitions are included in appropriate headers located in
arch/generic/.
